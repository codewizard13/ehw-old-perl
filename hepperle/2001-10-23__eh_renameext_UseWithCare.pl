# Program:	eh_renameext.pl
# Creator:	Eric Hepperle
# Date:		10/24/01
#
# Purpose:	I am having a problem trying to convert extensions w/ the following syntax:
#
#		mv *.perl *.pl
#
#		This is supposed to rename all files that end in .perl to 'whatever.pl'.
#
#		It just doesn't quite work.
#
#		This script should solve that problem.
