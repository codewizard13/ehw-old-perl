# Program:    As an HP employee, I use a program called CERES.
#             CERES is an html-based labor-reporting app that gives
#             a list of cases for one to close.  Each case opens
#             to its own page consisting of numerous fields.  Often,
#             a few key fields have incorrect info.  Procedurally,
#             to get the fields corrected requires one to contact
#             an Onsite Coordinator (OC for short) and request the
#             change through them.  This can be a hassle due to
#             language barriers, incompetence, and uncertainty on
#             their part as to whether they have permission to
#             perform the changes.  Subsequently, my senior coworker
#             Martin Hoel has requested that I create a program to
#             fix those fields before they are uploaded.  That is
#             the purpose of this program.
