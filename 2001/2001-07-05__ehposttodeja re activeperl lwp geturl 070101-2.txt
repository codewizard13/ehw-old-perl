HELP: ActivePerl LWP::SIMPLE module doesn't get url.

Greetings fellow perl Hackers:

This one has been troubling me for several weeks.  I am trying to use the get url function of the LWP::SIMPLE module to snatch source HTML code from any given web page.  I am using Active State's ActivePerl application on my Windows ME machine at home.  I have written most of my perl programs at work on AIX, and I do my prelim testing there before I bring it home.  Every program/script I have written on AIX has been successfully ported to my Win32 environment.  Everyone except my 'geturl' script.


EXAMPLE ONE:
----------

This is the first code I tried, which worked on UNIX but failed on my PC:

#!/usr/bin/perl -w
#
# Program:	ehgeturlparsejpgngif.pl
# Creator:	Eric Hepperle
# Date:		06/27/01
#
# Purpose:	Rips the source code of any url and
#		stores it as an html doc.
#
#########################################

# calls the LWP module (WWW LIBRARY).
use LWP::Simple;

print "Enter a url to retrieve: ";
$url = <STDIN>;

# I have tried it with or without chomping $url.
# Neither version works at home, but on UNIX it
# doesn't seem to need the url chomped to be
# successful
#
#chomp $url;
print "\n";

# This lets me assign the name of the doc.
print "Enter the name to give the resulting html document: \n";
print "(the program automatically adds \".html\" to the name)\n";
$docname = <STDIN>;
chomp $docname;

$docname = $docname.".html";
# another way to do this is:
#    $docname = "$docname\.html";
#


# Print Results to screen:
#

#$file = get("$url");
#@file = get ("$url");
#@file = get ($url);
$file = get ($url);

print "The url is: \n";
print "$url \n";
print "\n";

print "----------------------------------------\n";
print "\n";

print "The source code of the url is: \n";
print "\n";
print "----------------------------------------\n";
print "\n";
print "$file\n";

print "\n";


# Set HTML doc storage directory.
$destdir = "c:/windows/desktop/eh_ripped_htmldocs";

# assign a variable to address a fully-qualified
# file path-name:
#
$webfile ="$destdir/$docname";

open (WEBDOC, ">$webfile") || die "cannot open input file $webfile \n";

   print WEBDOC "<HTML>This is the code ripped from $url: \n";
   print WEBDOC "----------------------------------------\n";

   # This is the line that writes the ripped html code to
   # the newly created html doc.
   #
   print WEBDOC $file;

close (WEBDOC);

#----------
# This line keeps the ActivePerl command line
# interpreter from closing on completion.  Otherwise,
# you see a DOS window pop-up and quickly blow away;
# this line prevents that.
#
$hold = <STDIN>;
